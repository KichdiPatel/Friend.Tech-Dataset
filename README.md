# Friend.tech Data Collection

## Idea

During September/October 2024 there were a lot of people botting the Friend.Tech hype and purely buying the newly added accounts to the platform and reselling once they would increase since the first buyer gets a significant discount. My idea was trying to understand if there was a relationship between twitter statistics and other on chain factors that might impact a Friend.tech key's price.

## The Project

In this project, I develop a dataset that can be run and checked for a specific range of block numbers to find any new user creations and reverse-finding their twitter handles through their wallet address. I then utilized the twitter API to gather statistics around those accounts and compile it into a dataset. I was not able to determine any significant predictive variables at the time, however, if I were to redo this project it might be helpful to see factors like onchain spending, frequency of all base/eth transactions and other variables based on on-chain activity and see the relationship between newly created accounts. Now, the platform has significantly lost volume, and is not as luctrative for these types of opportunities.

Would love to hear thoughts!
